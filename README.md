# Launch Mobility Project

You are part of a new division of Launch Mobility, Inc. called “UrbanPilot”.

This new division wants to place cars at strategic locations so that customers
can have access to them and rent them using a mobile app. Our head of
operations, AJ, is eager to start deploying cars but he needs to know where the
best locations are.  At this time AJ goes to you asking for help. He needs a
website where users can enter their basic information including their current
zip code. Once there are enough zip codes collected we can proceed to analyze
what are the most appropriate locations and start deploying cars there.
